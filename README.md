The „Emergency Assist“ service platform, developed in the light of this business case, targets the goal of business efficiency in the healthcare sector. It functions as an interface between patients, emergency care providers and practicing physicians. Improvements are enabled through the utilization of artificial intelligence and robotic process automation. This digital service can easily be integrated into existing structures, and positively incentivizes its adoption by speeding up processes and creating more transparency. Different interactive interfaces provide optimal inclusion, especially with patients, and map an end-to-end process. After receiving initial funding for its pilot phase, the service is able to generate a positive impact, is viable on its own and can be subject to further scaling.
